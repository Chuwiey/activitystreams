## Introduction

This document is aimed at a high level understanding how the Activity Stream works with Neo4j. We have defined a broad structure that to talk to the database.





## Technology choices



### Node

### Neo4j

### Redis




This document is aimed at a high level understanding how the Activity Stream works with Neo4j. We have defined a broad structure that to talk to the database.




## Activity Stream Spec

ACTOR -> VERB -> OBJECT -> TARGET


mmdb_user -> FAVORITED -> yourshot_photo


## Graph Structure

Nodes have labels, the labels are bascially types of nodes we have. The current naming structure we for labels for are

	{app_name}_{model}

So an mmdb User would be

	mmdb_user
	
A Yourshot photo would be
	
	yourshot_photo
	
An ngm article would be
	
	ngm_article



### Node properties

Nodes currently have the folowing properties

	{app_name}_{model}_id : {int} / {slug} … open ended
	{app_name}_{model}_api : {url}
	type: {app_name}_{model}
	created: {unix timestamp
	updated: {unix timestamp}
	
The reason why we add an type to that node so that we can return the label for the node. 



For example an MMDB USER node will have the following:

	mmdb_user_id : 1
	mmdb_user_api: http://mc.dev.nationalgeographic.com:8000/user/1/
	type: mmdb_user
	created: 1388767442091
	updated: 1389039127283
	
Your Shot Photo

	yourshot_photo: 11121
	yourshot_photo_api: http://yourshot-uat.nationalgeographic.com/api/v1/photo/14055
	type: yourshot_photo
	created: 1388767442091
	updated: 1389039127283



### Edges

These represent represent relationships. They are in all caps and also have timestamps

List of Current Verbs:
	
	FAVORITED
	PLEDGES
	FOLLOWS
	
There shall be a master list of verbs that will be used within the graph. Users are not allowd to add new verb that are not in the master list.


### Activity Service REST API


Get all nodes of type

	'get /api/v1/:actor' --> /api/v1/mmdb_user
  
Get node of specfic id

	'get /api/v1/:actor/:actor_id' --> /api/v1/mmdb_user/1

Installation
============

# Java JDK 1.7
* Download the [latest 1.7 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * OSX users should just need to open the DMG and run the installer.
  * Debian
    * Download the [linux jdk 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    * `tar -xvf jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz` (64 bit) or `tar -xvf jdk-7u2-linux-i586.tar.gz` (32 bit)
    * `sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm`
    * `sudo mv ./jdk1.7.0_02 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0`
    * Next run the following:
      ```
        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/java" 1
        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javac" 1
        sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/bin/javaws" 1
      ```

    * Change permissions:
      ```
        sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/java 
        sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javac
        sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/javaws
        sudo chown -R root:root /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0
      ```
      
    * `sudo update-alternatives --config java`
    * You will see output similar one below - choose the number of jdk1.7.0 - for example 3 in this list:
      ```
        $sudo update-alternatives --config java
        There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

        Selection Path Priority Status
        ————————————————————
        0 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java 1061 auto mode
        1 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java 1061 manual mode
        2 /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java 63 manual mode
        3 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/bin/java 3 manual mode

        Press enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 3
        update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0/jre/bin/java to provide /usr/bin/java (java) in manual mode.
      ```
    * `java -version` to chech if you are using the correct version
    * Repeat for `sudo update-alternatives --config javac` and `sudo update-alternatives --config javaws`

# [Node](http://nodejs.org) 

(Until any of this goes to production we are not version locked, but if you must, we use 0.10.24 locally)

* OSX with Homebrew
  * `brew update`
  * `brew tap homebrew/versions`
  * `brew versions node`
  * `brew install node --upgrade`

* Debian/Ubuntu (Build from source) - recommended with debian
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python g++ make checkinstall
  mkdir ~/src && cd ~/src
  wget -N http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz
  tar xzvf node-latest.tar.gz && node-v* #(remove the "v" in front of the version number in the dialog)
  ./configure
  checkinstall
  sudo dpkg -i node_*
  ```

  Note: when you call checkinstall, make sure you edit the version when presented with:

  ```
  "This package will be built according to these values:

  0 - Maintainer: [ root@debian ] 1 - Summary: [ Node.js v0.10.24 ] 2 - Name: [ node ] 3 - Version: [ v0.10.24 ]"
  ```
  Version should be 0.10.24 NOT v0.10.24 otherwise your build will fail.

  From https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager

* Ubuntu (apt-get) More friendly with ubuntu
  * `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

# NPM 1.3.14
* OSX with Homebrew:
  * NPM was recently removed from Homebrew, so manually install `curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh`

# [Neo4j 2.0!](http://www.neo4j.org)
* Download the [Neo4j 2.0](http://www.neo4j.org/download)
* OSX:
  * `brew update`
  * `brew install neo4j`
  * `neo4j install`
  * Add to launchctl to make your life easier
  * `neo4j start`
* Debian/Linux
  * `tar xzvf neo4j-communtity.2.0.0-unix.tar.gz`
  * `mv neo4j-communtity.2.0.0-unix /etc/neo4j && cd /etc/neo4j`
  * `bin/neo4j-installer`
  * `sudo service neo4j start`
  * Uncomment "org.neo4j.server.webserver.address=0.0.0.0" in /etc/neo4j/conf/neo4j-server.properties for neo4j admin area


Dependencies
============
These files are part of the package.json file, so NPM is able to install them all with one command. `npm install`

* [Neo4j-JS](https://github.com/bretcope/neo4j-js) (this dependency might be swapped out soon)
* [Sails.JS](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation)
* [Sails-Neo4j](https://github.com/natgeo/sails-neo4j)

# Maven
* `brew install maven`

# Bundle
*This takes care of ruby/sass dependencies*
* `gem install bundler && bundle install`


Environment Setup
=================
```
mkdir ~/code/activitystreams
cd ~/code/activitystreams
git clone git@github.com:natgeo/activitystreams.git .
cd activitystreams
npm install
```

To run your server: `neo4j start` then `sails lift`
To view your server, visit http://localhost:9365

Activity Streams Demo
=====================

A simple demo page for the NatGeo Activity Streams project


Install
=======

add as.nationalgeographic.com to your /etc/hosts file

Usage
=====
A local instance of MMDB is also required for signing in and favoriting an image.  Clone the MMDB
repo, run through the installer, and run it on port 8000.  This sails server should be running as well.

Access the demo at http://as.nationalgeographic.com:9365/as-demo.  If you are not
on the .nationalgeographic.com domain, then the header controls will not display.


Sample Demo Script
==================
1. Access the page: http://as.nationalgeographic.com:6935/as-demo.html
2. Click on a heart underneath a page.  You should see an alert that tells you to log in.
3. Log in with a known account.
4. Click on a heart underneath a picture.  It should turn from black to pink.
5. Refresh the page.  The image you favorited should still have a pink heart.
6. Either use another browser or clear your browser cache. (**SEE KNOWN ISSUES**)
7. Refresh the page.  The hearts should be black and you should be logged out.
8. Log in and refresh the page.  The image you favorited should be pink.


Testing
=======
We are using the Mocha testing framework and have implemented it using grunt.

All our tests live in tests/

To run test:

    //Make sure sails app is running
    sails lift
    
In another terminal window:

	grunt test
	



KNOWN ISSUES
==================
- Sails.js may act inconsistently when connecting with socket.io.  Running sudo npm install in the base of the app may resolve this.


TODO
====
- Use socket.io to display the activity stream in the large box
